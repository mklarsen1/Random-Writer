This is a random generator designed to run in the terminal. Output can replace Lorem Ipsum text.

It must be run with one argument, which determined how many lines of text to generate. 

To use the text, output to a file with the >> command. Running will look like this:

python writeChars.py 10 >> youText.txt

Cheers
